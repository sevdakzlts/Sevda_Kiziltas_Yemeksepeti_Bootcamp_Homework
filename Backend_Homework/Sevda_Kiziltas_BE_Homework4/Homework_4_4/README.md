# Swagger

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/)  tooling for APIs built with ASP.NET Core. Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test operations, directly from your routes, controllers and models.

In addition to its  [Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0](http://swagger.io/specification/)  generator, Swashbuckle also provides an embedded version of the awesome  [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)  that's powered by the generated Swagger JSON. This means you can complement your API with living documentation that's always in sync with the latest code. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance, allowing you to focus on building an awesome API.


# Usage

After cloning this repository and installing [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/downloads/) enter the project's folder through the command line and type the following code to run the program:
`dotnet run`

The API will start up on  [http://localhost:59417](http://localhost:59417/), or  [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)  with  `dotnet run`.

You can use  [Swagger](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger/)  to  `GET http://localhost:59417`.
